This is a simulation program developed during my undergraduate studies (2016-2019) that models a Lorentz gas with periodic boundary conditions using Sinai's billiards. The program simulates the trajectory of free point-like particles moving in straight lines until a collision with a scatterer occurs. The program can also introduce shearing between different layers of scatterers to study internal moment diffusion (viscosity). The program uses a pseudorandom number generator (Wichman-Hill Random Number Generator) implemented in the ASA183 library, originally written in FORTRAN77 by Brian Wichmann and David Hill and later translated to FORTRAN90 by John Burkardt. The library is released under the GNU General Public License. Please note that this program was my first experience with programming and may not be optimized for efficiency.
