# Sinai
Program build during my undergraduate period (2016-2019). The algorithm is modelled to simulate a Lorentz gas with periodic boundary conditions, using the Sinai's billiards. The program simulates the trajectory of a given number of free point-like particles which move in straight lines, until a collision with one of the scatters occurs specularly. It also can introduce shearing between the differente layes of scatterers, due to our interest in the process of internal moment difusion, i.e., viscosity. The program depends on a pseudorandom number generator (Wichman-Hill Random Number Generator) implemented on the ASA183 library originally written on FORTRAN77 by Brian Wichmann and David Hill and later translated to FORTRAN90 by John Burkardt. The library is under the GNU General Public License license. This program was my first contact with programming and may not be as efficient as it could.
