# Sinai
Program build during my undergraduate period (2016-2019). The algorithm is build to simulate a Lorentz gas with periodic boundary conditions, using the Sinai's billiards. The program simulates the trajectory of a given number of point-like particles free to move in straight lines, until it collides with one of the stutterers. We have also introduced shearing to the model due to our interest in transport processes of viscosity. The program depends on a pseudorandom number generator implemented on the ASA183 library originally written on FORTRAN77 by Brian Wichmann and David Hill and later translated to FORTRAN90 by John Burkardt. The library is under the GNU GPL license
